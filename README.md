Upon going to the site, the user lands on the landing page. Here they are prompted to enter a city and a state that they wish to find a weather forecast for.

The user also has the option to compare a forecast for two different places. Upon clicking a link in the dashboard to compare weather, they are taken to a page where they can enter in two places to see a current forecast as well as a 10-day forecast for each place.
